# RougueLike

This is a prototype for a Rouguelike card game (similar to slay the spire) with realtime mechanics flavor.
Once you attack, if you can time the hit (which is random) you get different (this version only has 1 effect) effects.
Similarly when you defend, if you can time it again you benefit from that combo. Try it!
